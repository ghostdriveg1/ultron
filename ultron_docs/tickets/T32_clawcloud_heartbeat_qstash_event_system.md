# T32 — ClawCloud Heartbeat + QStash Event System

## Context
ClawCloud persistent heartbeat loop (30s interval). QStash event-driven architecture (no polling waste). Koyeb watchdog with 60s health check. GitHub Actions emergency fallback.

**Dependencies:** T31  
**Complexity:** HIGH

## Files to Create
